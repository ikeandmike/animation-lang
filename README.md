# animation-lang
Implementing an Animation Language: I did this project as part of CS 1102, Accelerated Introduction to Program Design, at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I created a function-based programming language designed for creating simple animations. A user can write programs using a macro-based interface, and create animations with circles and rectangles.
